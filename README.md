## >About Hamlick

* **Hamlick is a 16 year old gamer who enjoys playing Wolrd of Warcraft (WoW), especially on the weekends.**
* **Hamlick enjoys playing with his friends, and enjoyings running dungeons most**
* **Hamlick and his friends need a way of seeing which bosses are in each dungeon that way they can prepare themselves for the boss encounters properly**
* **Hamlick also enjoys taiming and training new pets in game, so he wants a way of seeing all the different pets available to him.**
* **Another thing Hamlick enjoys is being able to share the things he finds on WoW so he would like the ability to share the Bosses, Dunegons and Pets he locates in Questicon.**
* **As an added bonus, Hamlick sometimes likes to show his friends what his characters currently look like, he needs a way to show or share out his character's level as well.**
* **Lastly, Hamlick and his friends really enjoy challending themselves to see who has the most mounts, so a way to see all the in-game mounts would also be valuable.**

* **Create Questicon README**
* **Create User persona**
* **Build out prototype.**

* **Integrate logic for API calls and test out the API calls are calling the correct data from Blizzard's servers ~~Is data populating?**
* **Create custom array adapter to increase readability of the app and bolster UX/UI**
* **Utilize API call to populate more data into the Bosses, Pets, Mounts and Dungeons activities**
